## Usage Instructions

### **1. Setup and Installation**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate test data
npm run seed-issues

# Start the application
npm start
```

### **2. Accessing the Issue Detection System**

1. Navigate to the application dashboard
2. Click on "Issue Detection" in the sidebar
3. Click "Analyze Issues" to run the AI analysis
4. Review detected issues and recommendations

### **3. Understanding the Analysis**

#### **Issue Severity Levels**
- **Critical**: System-wide issues affecting multiple customers
- **High**: Significant impact on customer experience
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, needs attention
- **Low**: Minor issues, monitor for trends

#### **Health Status Indicators**
- **Excellent**: No significant issues detected
- **Good**: Minor issues with low impact
- **Poor**: Multiple high-priority issues
- **Critical**: System-wide problems requiring immediate action

### **4. Using Recommendations**

Each detected issue includes:
- **Root Cause Analysis**: What's causing the problem
- **Impact Assessment**: How many customers are affected
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific steps to resolve
- **Evidence**: Supporting data and ticket samples

## Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Delivery System Breakdown**
```

const detection = await response.json();

// Check for related issues
if (detection.data.relatedIssues.length > 0) {
  console.log('Related systemic issue detected:', detection.data.relatedIssues[0]);
}
```

### **Health Monitoring**
```javascript
// Get system health status
const response = await fetch('/api/issue-detection/health');
